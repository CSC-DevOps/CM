Building a Configuration Server
----------------------------------

Part 1. [Configuration Management Workshop](README.md)  
Part 2. [Building a Configuration Server](CM.md)  ‚¨ÖÔ∏è   
Part 3. [Ansible Playbooks](Playbooks.md)

## Workshop

An overview of the components we will set up can be seen here:

### Checking progress on workshop

To check the configuration of the ansible server and web server, we will use `opunit` to run checks on the virtual machines listed in the inventory file. We can run checks from the top-level directory as follows.

At any time, you can run the following in on your host computer's terminal:

```bash
opunit verify -i opunit_inventory.yml
```

## Creating a connection between your servers

You need a way to automatically connect to your server without having to manually authenicate each connection. We will create a pair of public/private keys for [authentication through ssh](https://www.ssh.com/ssh/public-key-authentication#sec-Asymmetric-Cryptography-Algorithms).

From your host machine, create a new public/private key pair, running the following command:

```bash | {type: 'command'}
ssh-keygen -t rsa -b 4096 -C "web-srv" -f web-srv -N ""
```

After generating the keys, you need to copy them onto the servers. The private key (*secret*, tell no one ü§ê), needs to be stored internally in the configuration server. The public key (üåê), needs to be _authorized_ for use on the web-server.

![ssh connection](img/connection.png)

#### Storing the private key in the configuration server ‚öíÔ∏è

We will need to first copy the `web-srv` file we generated.
üí°  One nice trick is to use a copy utility to copy a file into your copy/paste buffer.

* Mac: `pbcopy < web-srv`
* Windows: `clip < web-srv`
* Linux: [Check out one of these options](https://superuser.com/a/288333/862331).

Use of the the above clipboard commands or simply run `cat web-srv` to see and copy the content of the file. You can edit and fill the cell below:

```bash | {type: 'command'}
 
```


Using the notebook terminal or manually running `bakerx ssh config-server` from your own terminal.
Paste and store the private key you generated (web-srv) in a file located at `~/.ssh/web-srv`.

```bash | {type: 'terminal', target: 'config-server', 'background-color': '#43464B'}
```

#### Authorizing the public key on the web server üåê

Now, we need to authorize the key for use on the web server! Copy the `web-srv.pub` file you generated on your host in your clipboard...

Using the notebook terminal or manually running `bakerx ssh web-srv` from your own terminal...
Edit the file `~/.ssh/authorized_keys`, and add the public key to the list of authorized keys. üí•  Warning! Do not delete other entries, otherwise you might make your VM in accessible from ssh.

```bash | {type: 'terminal', target: 'web-srv', 'background-color': '#003670'}
```

Note: You might find this command useful for updating the entry if you're having trouble using ssh + file editor.

```bash
cat web-srv.pub | ssh -i ~/.bakerx/insecure_private_key -o StrictHostKeyChecking=no vagrant@192.168.33.100 "cat >> ~/.ssh/authorized_keys"
```

#### Testing your connection/Errors

Inside the config-srv, test your connection between the servers:

```bash | {type: 'command', target: 'config-server'}
ssh -i ~/.ssh/web-srv -o UserKnownHostsFile=/dev/null -o StrictHostKeyChecking=no vagrant@192.168.33.100 ip a -c
```

üí• You will likely see something like this!

```
@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@
@         WARNING: UNPROTECTED PRIVATE KEY FILE!          @
@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@
Permissions 0664 for '/home/vagrant/.ssh/web-srv' are too open.
```

If you see this warning, we need to remember to run `chmod 600` on our private key file, in order to reduce who can read or access this file.

```bash | {type: 'command', target: 'config-server'}
chmod 600 ~/.ssh/web-srv
```

Run the above ssh command again, it should be working! ü•≥

If you *still* see an error or prompt for a password, you most likely have a problem with your key setup. 

* Double check have pasted in the content in correctly (e.g., where you in insert mode in vim before pasting?). 
* Make sure you did not mix up your private/public key.
* Make sure you *did not* change the permission of authorized_key file, which would interfere with ssh's ability to read it!
* Try running opunit, to see if you fail any unexpected checks:

```bash| {type: 'command'}
opunit verify -i opunit_inventory.yml
```

## Performing commands over ssh

Once you have established a ssh connection between two servers, you have achieved an important milestone in configuration management. 

üóø You can now perform ad-hoc commands and even execute scripts on machines without having to manually log-in.

For example, when you run this command.

    ssh -i ~/.ssh/web-srv -o StrictHostKeyChecking=no -o UserKnownHostsFile=/dev/null vagrant@192.168.33.100 ls /

You can see the directory of the web-srv.

Practice: From your ansible-srv, create a file by executing the command below on the remote server. Verify it exists.

    touch ssh_test.txt

By this point, you should be able to pass the ssh setup checks in opunit: `opunit verify -i opunit_inventory.yml`.

## Ansible

While being able to run ad-hoc commands and scripts provides a useful capability, there are several constraints that make this impractical. 

Writing bash scripts can be error-prone. Most commands are not idempotent, meaning they may cause errors or unexpected behaviors if run multiple times on the same servers. Finally, configuration of servers is an inherently noisy problem, due to network issues and random service and hardware failures. This means, you often need to resume a configuration operation after experiencing partial failure.

Ansible is a tool for performing configuration changes on multiple machines. Ansible uses a push-based model for configuration management, performing idempotent commands over ssh, without requiring any agent running. The implementation is rather straightforward: _Ansible commands are translated into python snippets, and then copied over to the target machine, and executed. This requires that python is installed on the target machine_.

### Install

üéõÔ∏è  Inside the `config-server`, install ansible.

```bash | {type: 'command', target: 'config-server', stream: true, failed_when: "exitCode != 0"}
sudo add-apt-repository ppa:ansible/ansible
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install ansible -y
```

Now, we can use this server to send or "push" commands to other external servers, such as web-srv.

### Inventory

An inventory file allows ansible to define, group, and coordinate configuration management of multiple machines. At the most basic level, it basically lists the names of an asset and details about how to connect to it.

Inside the config-srv, edit the `inventory` file to include the ip address, user, and path to the private key:

```ini 
[web]
192.168.33.100 ansible_ssh_user=vagrant ansible_ssh_private_key_file=~/.ssh/web-srv 
[web:vars]
ansible_ssh_common_args='-o StrictHostKeyChecking=no'
```

Now, run the ping test to verify ansible is able to talk to the web-srv!

    ansible all -m ping -i inventory

We should see a successful connection!

```json
192.168.33.100 | SUCCESS => {
    "changed": false,
    "ping": "pong"
}
```

### Ansible commands

We can test our ability to use ansible for a simple configuration management task.

#### Installing nginx

Let's install a web server, called nginx (say like engine-X), on the web-srv VM. The web server will automatically start as a service.

    ansible all -b -m apt -i inventory -a 'pkg=nginx state=present update_cache=true'

Open a browser and enter in your node's ip address, e.g. http://192.168.33.100

#### Completing workshop checks

You should be able to verify all checks pass:

    opunit verify -i opunit_inventory.yml

Great work! 

Running ansible commands can be useful for exploration and debugging. However, we want to be able to organize these commands into reusable configuration scripts.

In Part 3, we will learn about creating and running ansible playbooks.


#### Extra fun

Can you provision a remote VM (from digitalocean/etc.) and then add its details to the inventory? Can you run your nginx command on it too?

## Common errors
Note, on older versions of ansible, you may fail to ping an item in your inventory if the server does not have python2. One workaround is to specify the python version explicitly. In newer versions of ansible, this will automatically be discovered by ansible. 

You can adjust the connection to account for this. Inside the inventory, add a new variable for all entries in `web` group:

```ini
[web:vars]
ansible_python_interpreter=/usr/bin/python3
```
